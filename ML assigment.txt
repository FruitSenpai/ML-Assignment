1. Our dataset is named adult data. It contains an extract of the data from the census of adults in the US. 
It has 32561 entries. After removal of unknown values, we awere left with 30726 entries.
There are 14 attributes and 1 target. The goal is to predict if the target(the income) is higher or lower
than 50k dollars. 
The 14 attributes are:
- age: continuous.
- workclass: Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Self-emp-inc, Federal-gov, Local-gov, State-gov, Without-pay, Never-worked.
- fnlwgt:final weight, continuous.
- education: Bachelors, Some-college, 11th, HS-grad, Prof-school, Assoc-acdm, Assoc-voc, 9th, 7th-8th, 12th, Masters,
 1st-4th, 10th, Doctorate, 5th-6th, Preschool.
- education-num: continuous.
- marital-status: Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Never-married, Separated, Widowed, Married-spouse-absent, Married-AF-spouse.
- occupation: Tech-support, Craft-repair, Other-service, Sales, Exec-managerial, Prof-specialty, Handlers-cleaners, 
Machine-op-inspct, Adm-clerical, Farming-fishing, Transport-moving, Priv-house-serv, Protective-serv, Armed-Forces.
- relationship: Wife, Own-child, Husband, Not-in-family, Other-relative, Unmarried.
- race: White, Asian-Pac-Islander, Amer-Indian-Eskimo, Other, Black.
- sex: Female, Male.
- capital-gain: continuous.
- capital-loss: continuous.
- hours-per-week: continuous.
- native-country: United-States, Cambodia, England, Puerto-Rico, Canada, Germany, Outlying-US(Guam-USVI-etc), India,
Japan, Greece, South, China, Cuba, Iran, Honduras, Philippines, Italy, Poland, Jamaica, Vietnam, Mexico, Portugal, 
Ireland, France, Dominican-Republic, Laos, Ecuador, Taiwan, Haiti, Columbia, Hungary, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Scotland, 
Thailand, Yugoslavia, El-Salvador, Trinadad&Tobago, Peru, Hong, Holand-Netherlands.

2. We first removed the data with unknown values since they might have been useful if it was a binary decision such as presence of 
data implies a decision and abscence implies another one. There is however to much uncertainty about the unknowns for them to be
used benefically.
An extra preprocessing step was needed as the attributes were both continuous and discrete. To train our models three possibilities were offered to us. 
a) ignore the continuous attributes since most of them are discrete anyway(10:5 discrete to continuous). This would however reduced the precision of 
the algorithm
b) convert the continuous into discrete using ranges.
c) convert the discrete into continuous using pandas. This is the one we opted for.
The dataset was also missing a first row to identify each attributes.

Finally splitting the data we used a ratio of 60:20:20

3. We decided to use Neural networks, Decision tree and a Random forest.

Decision tree vs Random forest: The main problem with decision tree is that they tend to overfit the data and as such the solution becomes pruning. 
Random forest however does not have this issue but because it is a bunch of decision trees running together the training time increases exponentially
and the resources needed(espacially when using recursion) can become a nightmare as our dataset grows.

Neural networks are  more precise and give less error than the two previous model but its blackbox type of model makes it hard to retrace decisions
and why they were made
